# productionHub

Production Hub aims to provide an interface that all members of the film set can access and use before and during a shoot day. 

It provides:
- Crucial information about the film set (including call sheets, contact info, a holistic overview, a full schedule, etc.) 
This would be accessible at all times, and help the set maintain communication. Upon accessing the application, the user would have access to a calendar that informs them of their current/upcoming productions. The user would be able then access more specific day-to-day information (call sheets, rough schedules, locations, etc.) as the calendar is updated. For every production, there is also a plan to make an interactive list that has the contact info of all members of the crew.

- A live, Twitter-like text feed of the current day, so everyone always what is happening on set (i.e. what scene is being shot where/when)
For example, if an actor was in his trailer waiting for the next scene to start, he would monitor the live feed. When it is time, an administrator would update the feed, and the actor, as well as any other necessary workers (i.e. make-up, wardrobe, etc.) would know to start preparing/heading over to the set.

- A post-shoot log detailing the events of the day. This would draw from the data in the live feed. 
This is mainly a tool for accountability and review. It would include check-in times, when each shot was rolled (i.e. 9:40AM - Scene 5, Take 1 was shot; 9:42 - Scene 5, Take 2 was shot; etc.), if anything of note happened (i.e. 5:05PM - Lead Actor suffers minor cut, 15 minute break for first-aid). This allows the director and other department heads to review the day, and will allow for optimization of future days.
